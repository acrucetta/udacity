# Udacity
This repository includes projects I've developed for the Udacity Nanodegree program.

## What is the Nanodegree program?
This program prepares you for a career as a data analyst by helping you learn to organize data, uncover
patterns and insights, draw meaningful conclusions, and clearly communicate critical findings. You’ll develop
proficiency in Python and its data analysis libraries (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib) and SQL as you build a
portfolio of projects to showcase in your job search.

## What projects does it include?
 
### Project 1: Investigate a Datase
In this project, you’ll choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.
You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your
findings

For this project, I analyzed historical weather trends within the Chicago region.

### Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results
In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use
statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and
recommendations in a report.

For this project, I analyzed the impact of educatin women in health outcomes.
